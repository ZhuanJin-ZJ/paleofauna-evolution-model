This directory contains a GPlates project file (GPROJ) that loads the "rigid" Muller et al. (2022) model for 1000 to 0 Ma. This model is provided in a paleomagnetic reference frame (Merdith et al., 2021) that is good for paleobiology and paleoclimate applications (default), and is also provided in an optimised mantle frame, and a no-net-rotation (NNR) mantle frame. 

- DataBundleForNovice-Muller_etal_2022.gproj

The GPlates project files will load in a number of geometry and rotation file layers that are all stored in the GeoData/FeatureCollections folders. If you go to File > Manage Feature Collections in GPlates, you can hover over the layers and it will provide you with the path. There is a Readme in each of those folders that explains what the data is and where it is from. 

To load these datasets in GPlates do the following:

1.  Open GPlates
2.  Pull down the GPlates File menu and select Open Project
3.  Click to select the GPROJ file
4.  Click Open 

Alternatively, drag and drop the GRPOJ file onto the globe. For more information, read the GPlates manual which can be downloaded from www.gplates.org.
