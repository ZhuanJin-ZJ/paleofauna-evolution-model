This directory contains a compilation of volcanic provinces from Johansson et al. (2018). Note that these features contain a range of emplacement modes, essentially any significant magmatism that is distinct from typical seafloor spreading-related magmatism. The features include age-progressive and non age-progressive volcanics. 

Please use the following citations for this dataset:

Version:
v1: This was used in the Johansson et al. (2018) manuscript
v2: gpml:UnclassifiedFeature changed to gpml:LargeIgneousProvince, and Iceland appearance changed from 15 Ma to 20 Ma.

Two file formats are given:

Johansson_etal_2018_VolcanicProvinces.gpmlz - native GPlates Markup Language .gpml compressed format
Johansson_etal_2018_VolcanicProvinces.shp - ESRI shapefile .shp format

To load these datasets in GPlates do the following:

1.  Open GPlates
2.  Pull down the GPlates File menu and select the operation Open Feature Collection
3.  Click the file format you want to load
4.  Click Open 

Alternatively, drag and drop the GPMLZ or SHP file onto the globe.

Note: When loading a shapefile, GPlates may prompt you to associate shapefile attributes with GPlates model properties. You just need to click OK. However, if loading your own shapefiles, you may need to ensure that the model properties are mapped correctly.
                   
In order to reconstruct these features, you will need to load in the underlying rotation model (.rot file) which can be found in the GeoData or downloaded from http://www.earthbyte.org/gplates-2-4-software-and-data-sets/.  

Play around with the GPlates buttons to make an animation, select features, draw features, etc.  For more information, read the GPlates manual which can be downloaded from www.gplates.org.
