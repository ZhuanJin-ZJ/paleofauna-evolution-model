This directory contains global set of gridmarks that have been cookie-cut using the Zahirovic et al. (2022) topological plate polygon and plate boundary dataset.

Please use the following citation for this dataset:

Zahirovic_etal_2022_Plate_Boundaries.gpml
Zahirovic_etal_2022_Feature_Geometries.gpml

Four file formats are given:

Zahirovic_etal_2022_GridMarks.gpmlz - native GPlates Markup Language .gpml compressed format
Shapefile/Zahirovic_etal_2022_GridMarks.shp - ESRI shapefile .shp format

To load these datasets in GPlates do the following:

1.  Open GPlates
2.  Pull down the GPlates File menu and select the operation Open Feature Collection
3.  Click the file format you want to load
4.  Click Open 

Alternatively, drag and drop the GPMLZ or SHP file onto the globe.

Note: When loading a shapefile, GPlates may prompt you to associate shapefile attributes with GPlates model properties. You just need to click OK. However, if loading your own shapefiles, you may need to ensure that the model properties are mapped correctly.
                   
In order to reconstruct these features, you will need to load in the underlying rotation model (.rot file) which can be found in the GeoData or downloaded from http://www.earthbyte.org/gplates-2-4-software-and-data-sets/.  

Play around with the GPlates buttons to make an animation, select features, draw features, etc.  For more information, read the GPlates manual which can be downloaded from www.gplates.org.
