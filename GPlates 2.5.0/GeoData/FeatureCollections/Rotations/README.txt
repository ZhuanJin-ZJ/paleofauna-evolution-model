This directory contains the Zahirovic et al. (2022) rotation file. It has an optimised mantle reference frame (recomputed since publication, when anchoring Plate ID 0), a no-net-rotation reference frame option (when anchoring Plate ID 666666), and the mantle frame from Zahirovic et al. (2016) (when anchoring Plate ID 705705). You can also activate the paleomagnetic reference frame from Merdith et al. (2021) by anchoring Plate ID 701701 - but be careful as the position of North America is not entirely consistent between 400-300 Ma. 

Directory contains one file:

- Zahirovic_etal_2022_OptimisedMantleRef_and_NNRMantleRef.rot

To load this dataset in GPlates do the following:

1.  Open GPlates
2.  Pull down the GPlates File menu and select the operation Open Feature Collection
3.  Click the file format you want to load
4.  Click Open 

Alternatively, drag and drop the file onto the globe.

In order to reconstruct these features, you will need to load in the underlying rotation model (.rot file) which can be found in the GeoData or downloaded from http://www.earthbyte.org/gplates-2-4-software-and-data-sets/.  

Play around with the GPlates buttons to make an animation, select features, draw features, etc.  For more information, read the GPlates manual which can be downloaded from www.gplates.org.
