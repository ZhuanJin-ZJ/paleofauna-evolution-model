This directory contains a velocity sampling mesh, which is a merge of a 33-mesh CitcomS mesh. It will require a continuously closing plate topology file, or you can manually link it to any (static) geometry layer in the Layer window in GPlates.

To load these datasets in GPlates do the following:

1.  Open GPlates
2.  Pull down the GPlates File menu and select the operation Open Feature Collection
3.  Click the gpmlz file to select it
4.  Click Open 

Alternatively, drag and drop the GPMLZ file onto the globe.
