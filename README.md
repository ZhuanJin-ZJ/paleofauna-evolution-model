# paleofauna-evolution-model
Model showing how paleofauna diverged as the continents collided and separated. 

Problem I want to solve: In the fossil record we see a radiation of paleofauna, such as the branching of theropods into abelisaurids, charcharodontosaurids, tyrannosaurids, and so on. 

This branching ostensibly occurs because of changes in environmental conditions, changes in food sources or predation pressures (see the Red Queen Hypothesis of evolution), changes in climate, tectonic shifts, etc.

I want to understand how much of these evolutionary divergences can be attributed to macro level environmental changes like tectonic shifts and climate shifts. To be clear, it would be impossible to model extinction-level events attributed to events like meteor impacts or extreme regional volcanism (Court Jester Hypothesis). This model would also exclude ocean fauna, as that would require modelling of paleobathymetry, ocean circulation in deep time, etc.

How: 

- To develop a “tape recorder” model of the Earth where tectonic plates drift toward, away from or parallel to each other, using triple joint intersections as fixed points. Fossil locations to be entered where they were found on the tectonic plates, and the tape can be “rewound” back to the time period where the specimen would have been alive. This will allow us, the viewers, to track where these creatures would have been in their paleoenvironment. I believe this is already being done for individual fossil specimens. What is different here is, the ability to map multiple branches of the same evolutionary family tree across geological time and space, to track where they were in relation to each other and to their biomes. This will likely give clues as to what caused their evolutionary divergence, sans extinction-level events or perhaps chemical changes that may be invisible through this lens.
- To superpose a climate model over this tectonic drift model to study how the climate would have differed for different regions for each species.

Use: This is useful not only for theropods, but for any paleontology study where there are physical fossils with known sites. Consider this a “general model” that would allow any paleontologist to plug in their fossil data, unwind time and tectonic drift, and track how these organisms moved in prehistoric time.

Caveats: We want these models to be interoperable - that is to say, we want to be able to swap models so that we can explore how different models will produce different results. This will give a picture of uncertainties involved.
