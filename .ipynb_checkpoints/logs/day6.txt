ðŸª¨ Day 6 Log â€“ Fossil Filtering, Refactoring, and Refocusing

What I worked on today:
    - Investigated why no fossil points were showing in reconstructions.
    - Discovered a likely mismatch between PBDB column names and my internal naming conventionsâ€”probably filtering everything out unintentionally.
    - Examined PBDBâ€™s CSV output in detail to better understand its schema.
    - Trimmed hardcoded paths and avoided repeated instantiation of the rotation model.
    - Refactored fossils.py and tectonics.py to use a central config.py, making the project cleaner and easier to scale.
    - Explored how to streamline data pipelines from fetch â†’ cache â†’ reconstruct.

What I learned:
    - Always sanity-check column names after fetching dataâ€”especially from APIs with automatic filtering or format changes.
    - Shared config and resource injection (e.g., rotation model) makes debugging and modular development much easier.
    - Fossil data requires not just spatial but temporal alignment, which Iâ€™ll need to debug more carefully.

Next steps:
    - Align internal arguments and filters with PBDBâ€™s actual column names.
    - Add more verbose logging to catch when data is silently excluded.
    - Consider writing test cases to confirm fossils are being reconstructed correctly at different time windows.

Mood: Frustrated but focused. Progress isn't always visibleâ€”but today felt like clearing the fog a little.
