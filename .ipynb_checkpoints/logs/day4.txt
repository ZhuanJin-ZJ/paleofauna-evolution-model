# Day 4: Dynamic loading of gpml files for full 1000â€“0 Ma reconstruction, modularised reconstruction of features

ðŸ”§ Technical Wins:
- Implemented conditional loading of plate boundary files based on reconstruction time:
        1000â€“410 Ma: Multiple GPMLs (Convergence, Divergence, Transform, Topologies)
        410â€“250 Ma: Single GPML
        250â€“0 Ma: Another single GPML
- Fixed the TypeError from trying to load multiple GPML files by creating separate FeatureCollection instances and merging them cleanly.
- Modularized plotting with plot_reconstructed_features() and added basic color mapping.
- Visualized coastlines and plate boundaries at arbitrary points in deep time (e.g., 150 Ma) using a Robinson projection.

ðŸ§  Insight:
    GPlates datasets often donâ€™t follow uniform formats, especially across large geological timescales.
    Sometimes, brute force understanding (trial + documentation + Stack Overflow-style error debugging) is the only path forward.
