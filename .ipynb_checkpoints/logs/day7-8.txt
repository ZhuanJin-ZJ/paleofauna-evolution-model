# Day 7â€“8: Independent fossil reconstruction and map overlay

ðŸ”§ Technical Wins:
- Created a fully standalone fossil reconstruction pipeline from scratch to isolate and test PBDB + PyGPlates logic.
- Successfully fetched and filtered 10,000 Theropod fossils from PBDB via REST API, dropping rows without spatiotemporal data.
- Debugged multiple silent failures by printing sanity checks and error traces line-by-line.
- Reconstructed ~670 fossils in the 110 Â± 5 Ma window using pygplates.RotationModel and geometry handling.
- Fixed major PyGPlates bug: replaced invalid `Feature.create_point_feature()` with valid manual construction via `Feature()` + `.set_geometry(...)`.
- Plotted reconstructed fossil locations on a global Robinson projection using Cartopy. âœ… Visual confirmation.

ðŸ§  Insight:
    When your main pipeline gets too noisy, carve out a clean sandbox.
    Debugging by print is still a high-leverage tool when you *donâ€™t know what you donâ€™t know*.
    Always assume the documentation is incomplete â€” test the actual behavior of the library.
