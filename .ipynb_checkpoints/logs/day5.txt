🗓️ Day 5: Time slider implemented for dynamic tectonic map reconstruction (0–1000 Ma)

🔧 Technical Wins:

    - Integrated ipywidgets.IntSlider to allow interactive geological time selection from 0–1000 Ma.
    - Successfully connected the slider to the reconstruction pipeline — maps update in real time as the user scrolls through time.
    - Solved critical issue where:
        Slider disappeared after one update — fixed by using interact() instead of observe() with manual clear_output().
        Plot didn’t update correctly due to overwritten or stale state — resolved by cleanly re-plotting and managing widget state.

    Kept plate boundary and coastline reconstruction modular and clean, preserving flexibility for fossil layer integration.

🧠 Insight:
	Interactive widgets demand a reactive coding mindset — procedural logic must yield to event-driven flow.
	When building exploratory tools in Jupyter, the "UI state" and "data state" must be kept cleanly separated to avoid stale output or disappearing components.
	
The path is now clear to layer in fossils — a second dynamic data stream that will sit atop the tectonic base.
