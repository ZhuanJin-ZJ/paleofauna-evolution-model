# Day 1 - Initial Setup

**Date:** 2025-05-15  
**Goal:** Load a base tectonic reconstruction model.

### ✅ Achievements

- Installed and configured pygplates (with GPlates 2.5 data).
- Successfully loaded rotation model and tectonic features.
- Tested basic reconstruction with static geometries.

### 🔍 Notes

- Used the Muller et al. (2022) dataset.
- Visualized with `matplotlib` and `cartopy`, but continents were static.

### 🚧 Next steps

- Add reconstructable features like dynamic plate boundaries and coastlines.
- Animate reconstructions across multiple geological times.
