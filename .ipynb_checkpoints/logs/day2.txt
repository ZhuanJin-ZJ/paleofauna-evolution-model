# Day 2 - Dynamic Plate Boundaries

**Date:** 2025-05-16  
**Goal:** Reconstruct and visualize time-varying plate boundaries.

### ✅ Achievements

- Loaded dynamic features: `250-0_plate_boundaries.gpml`.
- Used `pygplates.reconstruct()` to apply rotation model at 100 Ma.
- Rendered shifting plate boundaries using `matplotlib` and `cartopy`.
- Debugged common pitfalls (e.g., `PolylineOnSphere` vs `PolygonOnSphere`).
- Learned that `ax.coastlines()` shows *present-day* continents.

### 🔍 Insights

- Reconstructable geometries must be rotated explicitly.
- Continents don’t move unless `.gpml` coastlines are used.
- `cfeature.LAND` is static — use rotated geometries instead.

### 🚧 Next steps

- Load reconstructable coastlines and plot continents over time.
- Animate reconstruction from 250–0 Ma.
